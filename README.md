1. A <ins>completed</ins> version of part 1 of the homework titled **01-Animals.ipynb** where I take baby steps at using Pandas to _analyze_ data in ***animals.csv*** and discovered that Dhrumil made a <sub>cool</sub> contribution to _matlibplot_.
2. A <ins>completed</ins> version of part 2 of the homework titled **02-Billionaires.ipynb** where I take a stab at analyzing the data in ***richpeople.xlsx*** and expanded my horizons beyond _matlibplot_ by using _Altair_ to make a <sub>cooler</sub> charts.
